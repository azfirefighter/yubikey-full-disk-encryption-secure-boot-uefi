# YubiKey Full Disk Encryption

[This repository](https://github.com/sandrokeil/yubikey-full-disk-encryption-secure-boot-uefi "YubiKey Full Disk Encryption Repository")
contains a step-by-step tutorial to create a full disk encryption setup with two factor authentication (2FA)
via [YubiKey](https://yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/). It contains:

- YubiKey encrypted `root (/)` and `home (/home)` folder on separated partitions
- Encrypted `/boot` partition
- UEFI Secure boot (self signed boot loader)
- YubiKey authentication for user login

Currently guides for:

- Arch Linux

Additional security chapter:

- Disable INTEL AMT
- Disable AMD PSP

## Why
It took me several days to figure out how to set up a fully encrypted machine with 2FA. This guide should help
others to get it done in minutes (hopefully). There exists a plenty bunch of tutorials but no one contains a step-by-step
guide to get the above things done.

> I guess the entire manual will take between 1 - 3 hours.

## Prerequisites
You should be familiar with linux and should be able to edit files with `vi` [Vi Cheat Sheet](http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html).
You need an USB stick for the Linux Live environment and a second computer would be useful for look ups and to read this guide while
preparing your fully encrypted Linux.

And of course you will need at least **two** [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/ "Discover YubiKeys").

**WARNING:** You gonna get a bricked machine if you only have a single Yubikey and it breaks.
